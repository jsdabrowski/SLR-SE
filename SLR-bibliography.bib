  abstract      = {Mobile-app quality is becoming an increasingly important issue. These apps are generally delivered through app stores that let users post reviews. These reviews provide a rich data source you can leverage to understand user-reported issues. Researchers qualitatively studied 6,390 low-rated user reviews for 20 free-to-download iOS apps. They uncovered 12 types of user complaints. The most frequent complaints were functional errors, feature requests, and app crashes. Complaints about privacy and ethical issues and hidden app costs most negatively affected ratings. In 11 percent of the reviews, users attributed their complaints to a recent app update. This study provides insight into the user-reported issues of iOS apps, along with their frequency and impact, which can help developers better prioritize their limited quality assurance resources.},

  abstract      = {Nowadays software applications, and especially mobile apps, undergo frequent release updates through app stores. After installing/updating apps, users can post reviews and provide ratings, expressing their level of satisfaction with apps, and possibly pointing out bugs or desired features. In this paper we show-by performing a study on 100 Android apps-how developers addressing user reviews increase their app's success in terms of ratings. Specifically, we devise an approach, named CRISTAL, for tracing informative crowd reviews onto source code changes, and for monitoring the extent to which developers accommodate crowd requests and follow-up user reactions as reflected in their ratings. The results indicate that developers implementing user reviews are rewarded in terms of ratings. This poses the need for specialized recommendation systems aimed at analyzing informative crowd reviews and prioritizing feedback to be satisfied in order to increase the apps success.},

  abstract      = {Context: User feedback on apps is essential for gauging market needs and maintaining a competitive edge in the mobile apps development industry. App Store Reviews have been a primary resource for this feedback, however, recent studies have observed that Twitter is another potentially valuable source for this information. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess user feedback from Twitter in terms of timing as well as content and compare with the App Store reviews. Method: This study employs various text analysis and Natural Language Processing methods such as semantic analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze tweets and App Store Reviews. Additionally, supervised learning classifiers are used to classify them as semantically similar tweet and App Store reviews. Results: In spite of a difference in the magnitude between tweets and App Store Review counts, frequency analysis shows that bug report and feature request are discussed mostly on Twitter first as the number of Tweets during the reporting time reached the peak a few days earlier. Likewise, timing analysis on a set of 426 tweets and 2,383 reviews (which are bug reports and feature requests) show that approximately 15% appear on Twitter first. Of these 15% tweets, 72% are related to functional or behavioural aspects of the mobile app. Content analysis shows that user feedback in tweets mostly focuses on critical issues related to the feature failure and improper functionality. Conclusion: The results of this investigation show that the Twitter is not only a strong contender for useful information but also a faster source of information for mobile app improvement.},

These trends suggest a shift toward data-driven user-centered identification, prioritization, and management of software requirements. Developers should be able to adopt the requirements of masses of users when deciding what to develop and when to release. They could systematically use explicit and implicit user data in an aggregated form to support requirements decisions.

  abstract      = {Due to the rapid growth in the number of mobile applications (apps) in the past few years, succeeding in mobile app markets has become ruthless. Online app markets, such as Google Play Store, let users rate apps on a five-star scale and leave feedback. Given the importance of high star-ratings to the success of an app, it is crucial to help developers find the key topics of user-reviews that are significantly related to star-ratings of a given category. Having considered the key topics of user-reviews, app developers can narrow down their effort to the user-reviews that matter to be addressed for receiving higher star-ratings. We study 4,193,549 user-reviews of 623 Android apps that were collected from Google Play Store in ten different categories. The results show that few key topics commonly exist across categories, and each category has a specific set of key topics. We also evaluated the identified key topics with respect to the changes that are made to each version of the apps for 19 months. We observed, for 77% of the apps, considering the key topics in the next versions shares a significant relationship with increases in star-ratings.},

However, most of the studies done in this area mainly focused on mining and analyzing user reviews from the US App Store, leaving reviews of users from other countries unexplored. In this paper, we seek to understand if the perception of the same apps between users from other countries and that from the US differs through analyzing user reviews. We retrieve 300,643 user reviews of the 15 most downloaded iOS apps of 2018, published directly by Apple, from nine English-speaking countries over the course of 5 months. We manually classify 3,358 reviews into several software quality and improvement factors. We leverage a random forest based algorithm to identify factors that can be used to differentiate reviews between the US and other countries. Our preliminary results show that all countries have some factors that are proportionally inconsistent with the US.},

  abstract      = {A main advantage of app stores is that they aggregate important information created by both developers and users. In the app store product pages, developers usually describe and maintain the features of their apps. In the app reviews, users comment these features. Recent studies focused on mining app features either as described by developers or as reviewed by users. However, extracting and matching the features from the app descriptions and the reviews is essential to bear the app store advantages, e.g. allowing analysts to identify which app features are actually being reviewed and which are not. In this paper, we propose SAFE, a novel uniform approach to extract app features from the single app pages, the single reviews and to match them. We manually build 18 part-of-speech patterns and 5 sentence patterns that are frequently used in text referring to app features. We then apply these patterns with several text pre-and post-processing steps. A major advantage of our approach is that it does not require large training and configuration data. To evaluate its accuracy, we manually extracted the features mentioned in the pages and reviews of 10 apps. The extraction precision and recall outperformed two state-of-the-art approaches. For well-maintained app pages such as for Google Drive our approach has a precision of 87% and on average 56% for 10 evaluated apps. SAFE also matches 87% of the features extracted from user reviews to those extracted from the app descriptions.},

A precious source of information to plan such activities is represented by reviews left by users on the app store. However, in order to exploit such information developers need to manually analyze such reviews. This is something not doable if, as frequently happens, the app receives hundreds of reviews per day. In this paper we introduce CLAP (Crowd Listener for releAse Planning), a thorough solution to (i) categorize user reviews based on the information they carry out (e.g., bug reporting), (ii) cluster together related reviews (e.g., all reviews reporting the same bug), and (iii) automatically prioritize the clusters of reviews to be implemented when planning the subsequent app release. We evaluated all the steps behind CLAP, showing its high accuracy in categorizing and clustering reviews and the meaningfulness of the recommended prioritizations. Also, given the availability of CLAP as a working tool, we assessed its practical applicability in industrial environments.},

In software engineering, rationale management focuses on capturing design and requirements decisions and on organizing and reusing project knowledge. This paper takes a different view on rationale written by users in online reviews. We studied 32,414 reviews for 52 software applications in the Amazon Store. Through a grounded theory approach and peer content analysis, we investigated how users argue and justify their decisions, e.g. about upgrading, installing, or switching software applications. We also studied the occurrence frequency of rationale concepts such as issues encountered or alternatives considered in the reviews and found that assessment criteria like performance, compatibility, and usability represent the most pervasive concept. We then used the truth set of manually labeled review sentences to explore how accurately we can mine rationale concepts from the reviews. Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, trained on the review metadata, syntax tree of the review text, and influential terms, achieved a precision around 80% for predicting sentences with alternatives and decisions, with top recall values of 98%. On the review level, precision was up to 13% higher with recall values reaching 99%. We discuss the findings and the rationale importance for supporting deliberation in user communities and synthesizing the reviews for developers.},

A model of how employees will adopt BI apps is advanced based on theoretical foundations and recent thinking regarding how IT artifacts are becoming perceived of as "social actors within one's network." The theory cited asserts that individual's resource management instincts impact sentiment. Repeated app usage is clarified as ongoing appropriation. Actual app store review data is used to test the proposition that sentiment analysis can aid in addressing current practice bottlenecks in requirements engineering. A sentiment analysis tool suite is applied to over 5000 reviews of productivity apps as a proof of concept. Findings support that sentiment analysis can address current bottlenecks to requirements engineering, but that certain types of reviews tend to elude algorithmic analysis. Future needs for sentiment analysis algorithms in the space are suggested.},

  abstract      = {Mobile apps have exploded in popularity, encouraging developers to provide content to the massive user base of the main app stores. Although there exist automated techniques that can classify user comments into various topics with high levels of precision, recent studies have shown that the top apps in the app stores do not have customer ratings that directly correlate with the app's success. This implies that no single requirements elicitation technique can cover the full depth required to produce a successful product and that applying alternative requirements gathering techniques can lead to success when these two are combined. Since user involvement has been found to be the most impactful contribution to project success, in this paper we will explore how the Wizard-of-Oz (WOz) technique and user reviews available in Google Play, can be integrated to produce a product that meets the demand of more stakeholders than either method alone. To compare the role of early interactive requirements specification and app reviews, we conducted two studies: (i) a case study analysis on 13 mobile app development teams who used very early stages Requirements Engineering (RE) by applying WOz, and (ii) a study analyzing 40 (70, 592 reviews) similar mobile apps on Google Play. The results of both studies show that while each of WOz and app review analysis techniques can be applied to capture specific types of requirements, an integrated process including both methods would eliminate the communication gap between users and developers at early stages of the development process and mitigates the risk of requirements change in later stages.},

  abstract      = {App stores allow users to submit feedback for downloaded apps in form of star ratings and text reviews. Recent studies analyzed this feedback and found that it includes information useful for app developers, such as user requirements, ideas for improvements, user sentiments about specific features, and descriptions of experiences with these features. However, for many apps, the amount of reviews is too large to be processed manually and their quality varies largely. The star ratings are given to the whole app and developers do not have a mean to analyze the feedback for the single features. In this paper we propose an automated approach that helps developers filter, aggregate, and analyze user reviews. We use natural language processing techniques to identify fine-grained app features in the reviews. We then extract the user sentiments about the identified features and give them a general score across all reviews. Finally, we use topic modeling techniques to group fine-grained features into more meaningful high-level features. We evaluated our approach with 7 apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and compared its results with a manually, peer-conducted analysis of the reviews. On average, our approach has a precision of 0.59 and a recall of 0.51. The extracted features were coherent and relevant to requirements evolution tasks. Our approach can help app developers to systematically analyze user opinions about single features and filter irrelevant reviews.},

  abstract      = {App users can submit feedback about downloaded apps by writing review comments and giving star ratings directly in the distribution platforms. Previous research has shown that this type of feedback contains important information for software evolution. However, in the case of the most popular apps, the amount of received feedback and its unstructured nature can produce difficulties in its analysis. We present an interactive user feedback visualization which displays app reviews from four different points of view: general, review based, feature based and topic-feature based. We conducted a study which visualized 2009 reviews from the Dropbox app available in the App Store. Participants considered the approach useful for software evolution tasks as they found it could aid developers and analysts get an overview of the most and least popular app features, and to prioritize their work. While using different strategies to find relevant information during the study, most participants came to the same conclusions regarding the user reviews and assigned tasks.},

  abstract      = {App developers publish apps on different platforms, such as Google Play, App Store, and Windows Store, to maximize the user volumes and potential revenues. Due to the different characteristics of the platforms and the different user preference (e.g., Android is more customized than iOS), app testing cases on these three platforms should also be designed differently. Comprehensive app testing can be time-consuming for developers. Therefore, understanding the differences of the app issues on these platforms can facilitate the testing process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named CrossMiner to analyze the essential app issues and explore whether the app issues exhibit differently on the three platforms. Based on five million user reviews, the framework automatically captures the distributions of seven app issues, i.e., "battery", "crash", "memory", "network", "privacy", "spam", and "UI". We discover that the apps for different platforms indeed generate different issue distributions, which can be employed by app developers to schedule and design the testing cases. The verification based on the official user forums also demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework. Furthermore, we also identify that the issues related to "crash" and "network" are more concerned by users than the other issues on these three platforms. To assist developers in gaining a deep insight on the user issues, we also prioritize the user reviews corresponding to the issues. Overall, we aim at understanding the differences of issues on different platforms and facilitating the testing process for app developers.},

Therefore, in this paper, we mine user reviews in order to understand the user complaints of wearable apps. We manually sample and categorize 589 reviews from 6 Android wearable apps. Our findings indicate that the most frequent complaints are related to functional errors, lack of functionality, and cost. Our results are useful to the wearable developer community since they highlight the issues that users face and care most about.},

  abstract      = {In recent software development and distribution scenarios, app stores are playing a major role, especially for mobile apps. On one hand, app stores allow continuous releases of app updates. On the other hand, they have become the premier point of interaction between app providers and users. After installing/updating apps, users can post reviews and provide ratings, expressing their level of satisfaction with apps, and possibly pointing out bugs or desired features. In this paper we empirically investigate—by performing a study on the evolution of 100 open source Android apps and by surveying 73 developers—to what extent app developers take user reviews into account, and whether addressing them contributes to apps’ success in terms of ratings. In order to perform the study, as well as to provide a monitoring mechanism for developers and project managers, we devised an approach, named CRISTAL, for tracing informative crowd reviews onto source code changes, and for monitoring the extent to which developers accommodate crowd requests and follow-up user reactions as reflected in their ratings. The results of our study indicate that (i) on average, half of the informative reviews are addressed, and over 75% of the interviewed developers claimed to take them into account often or very often, and that (ii) developers implementing user reviews are rewarded in terms of significantly increased user ratings.},

These markets allow users to submit feedback for downloaded apps in the form of (a) star ratings and (b) opinions in the form of text reviews. Users read these reviews in order to gain insight into the app before they buy or download it. The user opinion about the product also influences on the purchasing decisions of potential users; that in trun, plays a key role in the generation of revenue for the developers. The mobile apps can contain large volume of reviews, which make it nearlyimpossible for a user to skim through thousands of reviews to find the opinion of other users about the features which interest them the most. Towards this end, we propose a methodology to automatically extract the features of an app from its corresponding reviews using machine learning technique. Moreover, our proposed methodology would aid users to compare the features across multiple apps, using the sentiments, expressed in their associated reviews. The proposed methodology can be used to understand a user’s preference for a certain mobile app and could uncover the reasons why users prefer one app over another.},

Since the manual analysis of user feedback is cumbersome and hard to manage many researchers and tool vendors suggested to use automated analyses based on traditional supervised machine learning approaches. In this work, we compare the results of traditional machine learning and deep learning in classifying user feedback in English and Italian into problem reports, inquiries, and irrelevant. Our results show that using traditional machine learning, we can still achieve comparable results to deep learning, although we collected thousands of labels.},

  abstract      = {Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearables are changing the way we do things, radically modifying our approach to technology. To sustain the high competition characterizing the mobile market, developers need to deliver high quality applications in a short release cycle. To reveal and fix bugs as soon as possible, researchers and practitioners proposed tools to automate the testing process. However, such tools generate a high number of redundant inputs, lacking of contextual information and generating reports difficult to analyze. In this context, the content of user reviews represents an unmatched source for developers seeking for defects in their applications. However, no prior work explored the adoption of information available in user reviews for testing purposes. In this demo we present BECLOMA, a tool to enable the integration of user feedback in the testing process of mobile apps. BECLOMA links information from testing tools and user reviews, presenting to developers an augmented testing report combining stack traces with user reviews information referring to the same crash. We show that BECLOMA facilitates not only the diagnosis and fix of app bugs, but also presents additional benefits: it eases the usage of testing tools and automates the analysis of user reviews from the Google Play Store.},

We proposed a method to label automatically mobile apps in terms of whether and to what extent they can satisfy users’ particular psychological needs. First, using the grounded theory approach, we conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews to identify types of needs associated with app usage. Substantive and theoretical coding of the data from the interviews as well as data from samples of app reviews yielded eight types of psychological needs app users had: utilitarian, low-cost, security, health, hedonic, social, cognitive, and self-actualization needs. Second, using the needs corpus (words and phrases) generated above, a classifier was trained using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to filter reviews in terms of whether they included needs-related comments. The classifier showed good performance. Finally, Labeled-LDA was used to automatically provide each review with multiple labels of the types of needs mentioned and the apps were analyzed for the different types of needs they satisfied.},

  abstract      = {Summary Compared with traditional software, the domain analysis of apps is conducted not only in the early stage of software development to gain knowledge of a particular domain but also runs throughout each iteration of apps to help developers understand evolution trends of the domain for maintaining their competitiveness. In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze app descriptions combined with reviews in App stores automatically and construct a feature-based domain state model (FDSM) in the form of state machine to support the domain analysis of apps. In FDSM, the domain knowledge up to a certain moment together is defined as a state. Initial state summarizes the high-level knowledge by gaining topics of app descriptions, whereas each transition is generated based on the information gained within one period of time and describes the change from the current state to the next one. Furthermore, user opinions in reviews are introduced into the model to quantify the value of information for helping developers get key domain knowledge efficiently. To validate the proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments based on Google Play. The results show that FDSM can provide valuable information for supporting domain analysis, especially in the evolution process of apps.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Reviews in App stores are a massive and fast-growing data resource for developers to understand user experiences and their needs. Studies show that users often express their sentiments on App features in reviews, and this information is important for the development and evolution of Apps. To help developers gain such information efficiently, this paper proposes a method using App descriptions, another typical data in App stores, to guide the analysis of reviews. Firstly, we extract App features from descriptions, then summarize them to gain topics of App features as high-level information; the results are formalized as a topic-based domain model (TBDM). Secondly, we train classifiers of reviews based on the model to establish the relationships between user sentiments and App features. Finally, a quantified method is given to analyze the model based on developer preferences for recommending and summarizing reviews. To evaluate our approach, experiments were conducted using the App descriptions and reviews collected from Google Play. The results indicate that the approach can classify reviews to their related App features effectively (average F measure is 86.13\%), and provides useful information for overall analyzing App features in a domain and identifying (dis)advantages of an App.},

  abstract      = {Context
Online software reviews have provided a wealth of user feedback on software applications. User reviews along with ratings have been influential in a series of software engineering tasks e.g. software maintenance and release planning.
Objective
Our research aims to assist managers in prioritizing features to be refined in next release from the perspective of enhancing user ratings via mining online reviews.
Method
We first extract software features from user reviews and determine their probability distribution in each review with LDA. Then the ground truth rating of each feature is estimated by linear regression under the assumption that the software functionality rating is a convex combination of all feature ratings weighted by their distribution probabilities over the review. Finally, we formalize feature refinement prioritization as an optimization problem which maximizes user groupâs rating on the software functionality under the constraint of development budget.
Results
The proposed approach can use topic model to jointly extract features from user reviews semi-supervisedly and determine each featureâs weight in each userâs rating on the software functionality. The estimated ground truth ratings of all features reveal how reviewer group evaluate those features. Finally, we provide an illustrative example to demonstrate the key idea of our framework.
Conclusion
Our proposed framework is general to various software products with mass user reviews and semi-automatic without much human efforts and intervention. The frameworkâs interpretability helps managers better understand user feedback on the software functionality and make feature refinement plan for the upcoming releases.},
