# Supplementary Material For SLR: Analysing App Reviews for Software Engineering

The repository contains suplementary materials for our systematic literature review. They are part of the journal submission. The materials include:

- data etraction form ("SLR-data-extraction-form.xlsx")
- database storing the meta-data of surveyed papers ("SLR-bibliography.bib")
- list and references to publicly-available app review mining tools ("publicly-available-tools.csv")
- list and references to publicly-available annotated datasets ("publicly-available-annotated-datasets.csv")

Do not duplicate the materials nor distribute them without authors' permission. 

We hope the new knowledge proviaded in our SLR will contribute to improving the quality of software engineering.
