# Supplementary material for A Systematic Literature Review: Analysing App Reviews for Software Engineering

The repository contains suplementary materials for our systematic literature review. They are part of the journal submission. The materials include:

- data etraction form ("SLR-data-extraction-form.xlsx")
- repository containing the meta-data of surveyed papers ("SLR-bibliography.bib")
